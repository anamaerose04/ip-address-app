IP Geolocation app
This project is an IP Geolocation Application that allows users to input an IP address and retrieve its geolocation details, such as country, city, and latitude/longitude. It offers features like simulating IP searches, outputting results in JSON format, and saving search history for future reference. The application is built for easy collaboration, using Git and GitHub for version control, enabling team members to contribute through branches and pull requests. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient tool for working with IP geolocation data while promoting collaboration in software development.
